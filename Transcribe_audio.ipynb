        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This Jupyter notebook provides an end-to-end solution for transcribing audio files using Google's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and OpenAI's Whisper ASR. It is designed to be flexible, supporting various audio file formats and even allowing for audio scraping from YouTube videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- **File Upload**: Upload audio files from your local machine for transcription.\n",
        "- **YouTube Audio Extraction**: Optionally, provide a YouTube URL to extract and transcribe audio.\n",
        "- **Multi-Service Transcription**: Utilizes both Google ASR and Whisper ASR for comprehensive and accurate transcription.\n",
        "- **Output**: Saves the transcriptions into a `.txt` file for easy comparison and further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use\n",
        "1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install all required Python packages.\n",
        "2. **Provide Audio**: Either upload an audio file or input a YouTube URL.\n",
        "3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells to transcribe the audio.\n",
        "4. **Download Output**: The transcriptions will be saved into a `.txt` file, which you can download.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A note on the two transcriptions services\n",
        "Two transcription services are used in this notebook, creating two versions of the transcript, which can be compared for accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Google ASR: A popular speech recognition service by Google.\n",
        "* Whisper ASR: An automatic speech recognition system by OpenAI.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whisper has five models of increasing size.\n",
        "\n",
        "When tested with an 8 minute .m4a audio clip of a Nigerian English speaker:\n",
        "* Whisper base.en downloads and runs quickly on Google Colab, outperforming the Google ASR transcription in accuracy, but still with many errors\n",
        "* Whisper medium.en is much slower to run, however its results seem to be significantly more accurate than base.en and ASR, producing a very usable transcript\n"
